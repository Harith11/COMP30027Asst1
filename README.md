# Wine Quality Classification with K-NN

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project for wine quality classification using the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm. The project is part of the COMP30027 Machine Learning course at the University of Melbourne (Semester 1, 2024).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a K-NN classifier to predict the quality of wines based on their chemical properties. The dataset consists of 2700 wine samples, with 11 features (e.g., pH, alcohol, density) and a binary class label (0 = low quality, 1 = high quality). The task involves:
- Implementing the K-NN classifier from scratch.
- Performing 1-NN classification and analyzing its performance.
- Normalizing the data using two techniques (Min-Max and Standardization) and comparing the results.
- Exploring model extensions such as additional distance metrics, weighting strategies, and classifier comparison.
